Summary:

In the 21st century, there will be two kinds of organizations: those that delight their customers and those that don't. The latter will be hard pressed to survive. The management structures that were spectacularly effective in the 20th century are insufficient to meet the challenges of the 21st. To meet these challenges, new management paradigms are emerging. 

This talk will examine the reasons why management is challenged and failing, the characteristics of successful management, and how the principles of Agile and Scrum can be applied beyond software development. Finally, it will introduce the Stoos Network, a nascent movement to build bridges beyond software and catalyze a lasting change in management.
