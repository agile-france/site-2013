Status: draft


I work as a full-time Agile Coach with Unruly, the leading global platform for social video marketing. Headquartered in London, we have 12 offices and employ over 140 people globally across APAC, EU, US including France.  
  
We've been applying eXtreme Programming (XP) from the start and that remains a core part of how we develop our software products. We also have grown our tech team so we can continue to develop new product offerings with rich user-experience while improving our underlying infrastructure to handle a growing amount of traffic and data. I was brought in to help the team split into multiple teams without losing the advantage XP gives us.  
  
As our company and customer base has grown, we've had to figure out how to evolve our products in a dynamic market place. Our advertising platform and analytics tools are used by other businesses not the man on the street, which makes user satisfaction a challenge. Our products also depend on platforms that can change overnight such as YouTube, FaceBook, Twitter. We also need to rapidly scale our offerings moving swiftly from skeletal MVPs to reliable solutions. We’ve learned that we need to keep our product options open so we can pivot and turn with the market.  
  
Traditional XP relies on an on-site customer so how do we make plans with our internal stakeholders spread across the globe? Many companies create different departments for interfacing to the business and delegate decisions to a Scrum Product Owner. At Unruly, we turn this on it’s head and our product development teams are responsible for identifying the most valuable features to work on next.  

Come to this session to hear about how we use XP for Product Development and where we've had to make adjustments to blend in practices from Lean Startup.
