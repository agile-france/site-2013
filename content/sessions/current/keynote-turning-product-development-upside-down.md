Summary: 

At Unruly we have been applying eXtreme Programming (XP) from the start. In 8 years, we have grew our technical team so we can develop new product offerings with rich user-experience while improving our underlying infrastructure to handle a growing amount of traffic and data. 

Traditionally XP relies on an on-site customer to help developers understand what’s most important to develop next. So how do we make plans with internal stakeholders spread across the globe? When startups grow they often create departments to interface with the business and delegate decisions to Product Managers. At Unruly, we turn this on it’s head, our product development teams are responsible for identifying the most valuable features to work on next and work with business stakeholders directly.  

We’ve learned that we need to keep our product options open so we can pivot and turn with a dynamic market. We had to figure out how to separate product strands that teams could develop independently. Come to this session to hear about how we use XP for Product Development and where we've had to make adjustments to blend in practices from Lean Startup.
