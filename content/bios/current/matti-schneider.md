Keeping out of the little boxes all the same. Software engineer, anthropology student, wannabe designer, concerned citizen.
Matti works in a startup developing a web application dedicated to innovative medical management. To this end, he co-designs all processes, experimenting with advanced agility practices and uncompromising quality control: when your webapp is to be used by surgeons every day, you have no choice but ensure quality is there!
